```
Unique values in 'Condition2' column in training data: ['Norm' 'PosA' 'Feedr' 'PosN' 'Artery' 'RRAe']
Unique values in 'Condition2' column in validation data: ['Norm' 'RRAn' 'RRNn' 'Artery' 'Feedr' 'PosN']
```

Fitting a label encoder to a column in the training data creates a corresponding integer-valued label for each unique value that appears in the training data. In the case that the validation data contains values that don't also appear in the training data, the encoder will throw an error, because these values won't have an integer assigned to them. Notice that the 'Condition2' column in the validation data contains the values 'RRAn' and 'RRNn', but these don't appear in the training data -- thus, if we try to use a label encoder with scikit-learn, the code will throw an error. 

-> training and validation datasets need to be matched since a label encoder refers to the training data to assign integer values for each unique value so if the validation data contains data that training data doesn't have it will throw an error

```python
# All categorical columns
object_cols = [col for col in X_train.columns if X_train[col].dtype == "object"]

# Columns that can be safely label encoded
good_label_cols = [col for col in object_cols if 
                   set(X_train[col]) == set(X_valid[col])]
        
# Problematic columns that will be dropped from the dataset
bad_label_cols = list(set(object_cols)-set(good_label_cols))
        
print('Categorical columns that will be label encoded:', good_label_cols)
print('\nCategorical columns that will be dropped from the dataset:', bad_label_cols)
```
