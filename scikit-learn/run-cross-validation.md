# Run Cross-Validation

It is a little surprising that we specify negative MAE. Scikit-learn has a convention where all metrics are defined so a high number is better. Using negatives here allows them to be consistent with that convention, though negative MAE is almost unheard of elsewhere.

We typically want a single measure of model quality to compare alternative models. So we take the average across experiments.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score

# Multiply by -1 since sklearn calculates *negative* MAE
scores = -1 * cross_val_score(my_pipeline, X, y,
                              cv=5,
                              scoring='neg_mean_absolute_error')

print("MAE scores:\n", scores)
print("Average MAE score (across experiments):")
print(scores.mean())
```
